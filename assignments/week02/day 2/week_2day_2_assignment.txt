1.I python, float and integer seems to be same in terms of bytes, but float stores values in floating points.
  so integer cant store values in that manner.
  float goes up to the higher oder of the value but it wont reach that value.
  i.e eg :1.999999 instead of 2
2.1GB= 8589934592 bits
  1MB= 8388608 bits
